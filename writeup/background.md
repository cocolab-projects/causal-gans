# Background

## Psychology

### Prior expectations affect counterfactual and causal judgements

Statistical normality.

### People use counterfactual simulation to understand "cause"

@gerstenberg_eye-tracking_2017 used eyetracking to address the question of whether people spontaneously consider counterfactual outcomes while making causal judgements. They tracked eye movements while participants judged whether one billiard ball caused another to go through a gate. When asked for _causal_ judgements like this, but not when asked about details of the _outcome_ (how close the caused ball came to the edge of the gate), participants' eye movements traced the counterfactual path that the caused ball would have taken had the causing ball been absent.
