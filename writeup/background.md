## Background

### Psychology

#### People use counterfactuals to understand "cause"

@gerstenberg_eye-tracking_2017 used eyetracking to more directly show that people spontaneously consider counterfactual outcomes while making causal judgements. They tracked eye movements while participants judged whether one billiard ball caused another to go through a gate. When asked for _causal_ judgements like this, but not when asked about details of the _outcome_ (how close the caused ball came to the edge of the gate), participants' eye movements traced the counterfactual path that the caused ball would have taken had the causing ball been absent.

#### Expectations affect counterfactual and causal judgements

When researchers discuss the role of expectations in counterfactual and causal reasoning, they typically refer to two main categories of expectations: _statistical normality_ and _prescriptive normality_. Statistical normality refers to the probabilities of what is likely to occur, whereas prescriptive normality refers to what "should" occur. Both seem to influence causal reasoning, and both concepts of normality seem to have similar effects.

People often imagine counterfactual changes that would undo a negative outcome, thinking things like "If only he had driven home a little later, he wouldn't have gotten in a car crash." @kahneman_simulation_1981 show that people are sensitive to statistical normality when deciding on an "if only..." counterfactual. They presented stories where they varied whether a character Mr. Jones went home at the usual time via an unusual route or went home at an unusually early time via his usual route. Participants were much more likely to mention counterfactuals where Mr. Jones behaved more like he usually did, choosing the route to counterfactually change when the route had been unusual, and choosing the time to  counterfactually change when the time had been unusual.

@icard_normality_2017 summarize the ways that statistical and prescriptive normality affect causal judgements into three main categories:

* **Abnormal inflation**: When there are multiple necessary causal factors for an outcome, people will be more likely to call something a cause if it is abnormal.
* **Supersession**: When there are multiple necessary causal factors for an outcome, people will be more likely to call something a cause if the _other_ factors are normal.
* **No supersession with disjunction**: When there are multiple _sufficient_ causal factors for an outcome (i.e. any one of the factors could have produced the outcome independently), people's judgements of how likely something is to be a cause does _not_ depend on the normality of the other factors.

They show how a model of causal reasoning based on _probabilistic sampling_ of counterfactual situations would result in these observed phenomena. They further present an additional principle, predicted by their model:

* **Abnormal deflation**: When there are multiple _sufficient_ (but not necessary) causal factors for an outcome, people will be more likely to call something a cause if it is normal.

They present an experiment with animations simulating billiard balls colliding, representing either conjunctive (multiple necessary factors) or disjunctive (multiple sufficient factors) causal scenarios. As predicted, they demonstrate abnormal inflation in the conjunctive scenario and abnormal deflation in the disjunctive scenario.
