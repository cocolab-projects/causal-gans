# Background

## Psychology

### Prior expectations affect counterfactual and causal judgements

People often imagine counterfactual changes that would undo a negative outcome, thinking things like "If only he had driven home a little later, he wouldn't have gotten in a car crash." @kahneman_simulation_1981 show that people are sensitive to prior expectations when deciding on an "if only..." counterfactual. They presented stories where they varied whether a character Mr. Jones went home at the usual time via an unusual route or went home at an unusually early time via his usual route. Participants were much more likely to mention counterfactuals where Mr. Jones behaved more like he usually did, choosing the route to counterfactually change when the route had been unusual, and choosing the time to  counterfactually change when the time had been unusual.

### People use counterfactual simulation to understand "cause"

@gerstenberg_eye-tracking_2017 used eyetracking to more directly show that people spontaneously consider counterfactual outcomes while making causal judgements. They tracked eye movements while participants judged whether one billiard ball caused another to go through a gate. When asked for _causal_ judgements like this, but not when asked about details of the _outcome_ (how close the caused ball came to the edge of the gate), participants' eye movements traced the counterfactual path that the caused ball would have taken had the causing ball been absent.
